# Implementation of famous sorting algorithms and comparing their performance

## Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is the most basic sorting method, which in each pass compares all adjacent numbers and swap them if they are in the wrong order. For example, with the first pass the largest/smallest number will end up in the last index.
Time complexity = O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Space complexity = O(n)

## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort works similar to the sorting of playing cards in hands. It is assumed that the first card is already sorted in the card game, and then we select an unsorted card. If the selected unsorted card is greater than the first card, it will be placed at the right side; otherwise, it will be placed at the left side. Similarly, all unsorted cards are taken and put in their exact place.
Time complexity = O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Space complexity = O(n)
